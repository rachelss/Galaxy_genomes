# Working with Target Genes {#gene}

## Finding gene locations

1. Open the .gbk file from the prokka annotation outputs
2. At the top, press “show all” 
3. Use CTRL + F to search for the rpoS gene by typing /gene="rpoS"
4. Locate the gene on the file and note the CDS position on the line immediately above the gene name
5. Scroll up the file to determine which contig the gene is located on. Before the genes are listed, there is a section of identifying information about the contig.

## Observing genes in the genome

1. Go back to Jbrowse
2. Navigate to the target contig using the drop down menu in the center top. 
3. In the search bar, input the target region in the format of “contig_x:XX..XX” where x is the contig number and XX..XX is the CDS region. 
4. Zoom in to look at the sequence of the gene

## Aligning Sequences

1. Open Jbrowse for the two strains you are comparing against
2. Navigate to the desired gene location using the steps above
3. Click on the gene and download the FASTA file by pressing the “FASTA” button
4. Upload the downloaded sequences into Galaxy
5. Open needle (left side of screen: Genomic Toolkits > EMBOSS > needle)
5. Insert the sequences under “Sequence 1” and “Sequence 2”
6. Click “Run tool”
7. View the alignment
