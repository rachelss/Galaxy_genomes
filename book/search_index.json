We can use genetic techniques to delimit species, define populations, understand reproductive patterns systems, and answer many other interesting biological questions. This workshop is designed to allow you to go from bacteria through genome comparisons to identify mutations and structural changes in genomes. This workshop will provide an introduction to next-generation sequencing technology for biologists. 2.2 Case Studies In this course, we will focus on two projects in bacteria. The first project will sequence Haemophilus parainfluenzae, a common commensal organism of the normal oropharynx, recognized as an opportunistic pathogen causing systemic diseases. We will compare strains where particular genes have been deleted to the reference sequence. The second project will compare multiple strains of pathogenic E. coli to identify novel mutations that may be correlated with phenotype. This tutorial steps through the basic process of using Galaxy to assemble and examine these genomes. 2.3 Course Objectives The goals of this course are to give participants a fundamental understanding of how genome sequencing works and how those data are analysed to draw conclusions. 2.4 Genomic data By definition genomes are large. The human genome is 3.2 billion base pairs. Even though bacterial genomes are just 2-4 million base pairs, if you were to go through and compare two genomes by hand to discover the differences between them it would take a while. To add to this complexity, genomes don’t come off the sequencer as a single sequence, but as millions of small fragments or thousands of large ones (depending on the technology). Think of this sequencing method as tossing a book (your genome) into a paper shredder. That means first you have to compare each fragment to a “reference genome” (like the real book) and then figure out where your genome differs from the reference. This is definitely a process you don’t want to do by hand! A computer (at least a big one with lots of computing power) can help us out by automating all these comparisons. That means that before we can identify how the sequence of two samples differ we need to learn to work with the tools to process our data.

This file is in FASTQ format, in which each read is represented over four lines described as follows. A header beginning with the “@” symbol and labeling the read. Notice that because these are read pairs, the first two reads’ headers are the same and end with “/1” and “/2”. The read as a sequence of nucleotides. A line containing a “+” symbol to indicate the end of nucleotides. This line may have more header information, but doesn’t for this dataset. A collection of ASCII symbols representing Phred quality scores. The i-th quality score corresponds to the i-th nucleotide in the read. Phred scores are helpful for a variety of reasons. For example, researchers will throw out reads having a significant number of bases that do not meet a certain Phred score threshold, especially if the reads have high coverage. 3.2 Getting started with Galaxy To to all of our work, including genome assembly and annotation, we will use the service Galaxy, an open source project that allows us to run often testy bioinformatics software in the cloud without the hassle of dealing with local installations. Please follow these step-by-step instructions to register on Galaxy: Create an account on Galaxy at https://usegalaxy.org/login. Your “public name” can be whatever you like, but you should fill out all fields. After creating an account, log in to Galaxy. Click on the plus ‘+’ on the top right of the page and create a new “history” (i.e., project that will contain data and the results of software runs) with a name that is relevant to the data you are analyzing. Some of you are analyzing E. coli and others H. para so please name accordingly in case you want to try another analysis later. All of the following analysis will be performed under this history. If you run a second analysis make sure to make a new history! 3.3 Getting your sequencing data Click on the ‘Upload Data’ button on the left side of the screen. Ask the instructor about uploading the data from your sample onto Galaxy. When the job turns green, click on the “eye” symbol next to one of your fastq files under your history on the right side of the page. The page may take a few seconds to load, and Galaxy will show you the first megabyte of your read file. 3.4 Assembling a genome Now that we understand our data a bit better, we are ready to assemble the genome from our data using Flye. Under Genomic File Manipulation - Nanopore on the left side of the page, you will see various tools. Click on Flye, which will take you to its homepage. You need to select the data that Flye will use to assemble your genome. Under Input reads, click on the Multiple Datasets button. Click the drop down arrow and select each dataset one at a time. Leave all the remaining parameters as default. Click Run! The assembly will show up as green in your history when it has completed. This should take ~10-30 minutes depending on the size of the genome. 3.5 Quality checking the assembly Now that Flye has completed, we will analyze the results. Quast (Gurevich et al. 2013) is a tool providing quality metrics for assemblies, and can also be used to compare multiple assemblies. The tool can also take an optional reference file as input, and will provide complementary metrics. QUAST stands for QUality ASsessment Tool. 1. From the left menus select Genomics Analysis - Assembly - Quast Set parameters as Assembly Mode: Individual Select your assembly Leave all other parameters as defaults Run tool (it should be done in a few minutes) View the HTML report from QUAST by clicking on the ‘eye’ in the analysis on the right. The Quast tool outputs assembly metrics as an html file with metrics and graphs. How many contigs (i.e. genome fragments) did your assembly produce? What is the total read length? Is this what you expect from your sample? (Check out the reference E. coli or the reference H. parainfluenzae) What is the N50 value? Congratulations! You have assemble a bacterial genome that no one else has ever seen before! "],["align.html", "Chapter 4 Genome Alignment 4.1 Obtaining a reference genome 4.2 Aligning two samples", " Chapter 4 Genome Alignment 4.1 Obtaining a reference genome To align your assembled genome against a reference genome, we first need to import this reference to Galaxy. Select the “NCBI Accession Download” tool under “Get Data” on the left side of the Galaxy page. Under “Select source for IDs”, select “Direct Entry”. Under ID List, type NC_004431 (for E. coli) or NZ_CP133470.1 (for H. para). Click “Run Tool” 4.2 Aligning two samples Now we are ready to align the two genomes. Under “Multiple Alignments” select “Mummer” For sequence 1, select the reference by clicking the “…” and selecting NC_004431. For sequence 2, select the contigs that you produced with Flye. Keep the other parameters default. Click “Run Tool” This should take a couple of minutes. In the righthand box labeled “Mummer”…“plot” click the “eye” to view the alignment. Diagonal lines indicate sections of the sample genome that align with the reference as in the following example: "],["annot.html", "Chapter 5 Genome Annotation 5.1 Annotation 5.2 Viewing the annotation", " Chapter 5 Genome Annotation 5.1 Annotation Finally, we will annotate the genome, meaning that we will identify putative genes and then compare these genes against a database of known genes to find which ones align the best. The identification of putative genes can be done in a variety of ways. One way to find these regions requires the observation that regions of DNA that are translated into protein start with a start codon (ATG) and end with a stop codon (TAG, TAA, or TGA). If a genome were random, then after encountering a start codon, we would expect to see a stop codon after about 64/3 ~ 21 codons. But real genes are typically much, much longer than 21 codons. As a result, in simple organisms like viruses and bacteria, a great way to find genes is to look for long stretches of codons connecting a start codon to a stop codon, with no intermediate stop codons. Once we have found putative genes along the genome, we can compare them against a database of genes using an algorithm called BLAST. These two steps are taken by our next tool, called Prokka, which is used to annotate the genomes of viruses, bacteria, and archaea. Select Prokka under Genomics Analysis - Annotation on the left. Under “Contigs to annotate”, select your contigs from the Flye run. Set “Kingdom” to “Bacteria” and leave all other parameters to default. Note that Prokka only annotates contigs of length at least 200. Click “Run”. The entire process of annotating your genome should not take more than a few minutes. Prokka produces a collection of output files in the history on the right. - The .fna file contains the contigs included in the annotation. - The .gff file contains regions identified by Prokka as genes. - The .ffn file contains nucleotide sequences of the annotated genes, and the .faa file contains their translated amino acid sequences. More detailed descriptions of the outputs can be found at https://github.com/tseemann/prokka#output-files 5.2 Viewing the annotation Prokka contains the annotation information in these files, but what a biologist would really like is a visualization of its genes and what they have been predicted to be. So to visualize our annotation contained in the .gff file, we will use a genome browser tool called “JBrowse” Click (on the left side of screen) “Statistics and Visualization” &gt; “Graph/Display data” &gt; “Jbrowse” Under “Reference genome to display” select “use genome from history” Under “Select reference genome” select the .fna file from the prokka annotation outputs. Click “insert track group” and then “insert annotation track” Under “GFF/GFF3/BED Track Data” select the .gff file from the prokka annotation outputs Click “Run tool” JBrowse should be very quick. When it is finished, click view file, which is an HTML file that we can view in the browser. (It may take a moment to load.) 8 . On the left side of the page, click on “Prokka on data XXX: gff” to show our annotation of the genome. The arrows point in the direction to indicate which strand of the genome the gene is found on. Click on a gene to obtain information about its length and what in the database it was similar to (if anything).
